DESCRIPTION
    This module is a POE::Component::IRC plugin which uses
    POE::Component::IRC::Plugin for its base. It provides interface to look
    up Unicode chars/code points from IRC. It accepts input from public
    channel events, "/notice" messages as well as "/msg" (private messages);
    although that can be configured at will.

CONSTRUCTOR
  new
        # plain and simple
        $irc->plugin_add(
            'UnicodeUCD' => POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Unicode::UCD->new
        );

        # juicy flavor
        $irc->plugin_add(
            'UnicodeUCD' =>
                POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Unicode::UCD->new(
                    auto             => 1,
                    response_event   => 'irc_unicode_ucd',
                    banned           => [ qr/aol\.com$/i ],
                    root             => [ qr/mah.net$/i ],
                    addressed        => 1,
                    trigger          => qr/^utf8?\s+(?=\S)/i,
                    listen_for_input => [ qw(public notice privmsg) ],
                    eat              => 1,
                    debug            => 0,
                )
        );

    The "new()" method constructs and returns a new
    "POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::Unicode::UCD" object suitable to be fed to
    POE::Component::IRC's "plugin_add" method. The constructor takes a few
    arguments, but *all of them are optional*. Note: arguments can be
    changed on the fly, just assign to $plugin_object->{some_argument}. The
    possible arguments/values are as follows:

   auto
        ->new( auto => 0 );

    Optional. Takes either true or false values, specifies whether or not
    the plugin should auto respond to requests. When the "auto" argument is
    set to a true value plugin will respond to the requesting person with
    the results automatically. When the "auto" argument is set to a false
    value plugin will not respond and you will have to listen to the events
    emited by the plugin to retrieve the results (see EMITED EVENTS section
    and "response_event" argument for details). Defaults to: 1.

   response_event
        ->new( response_event => 'event_name_to_recieve_results' );

    Optional. Takes a scalar string specifying the name of the event to emit
    when the results of the request are ready. See EMITED EVENTS section for
    more information. Defaults to: "irc_unicode_ucd"

   banned
        ->new( banned => [ qr/aol\.com$/i ] );

    Optional. Takes an arrayref of regexes as a value. If the usermask of
    the person (or thing) making the request matches any of the regexes
    listed in the "banned" arrayref, plugin will ignore the request.
    Defaults to: "[]" (no bans are set).

   root
        ->new( root => [ qr/\Qjust.me.and.my.friend.net\E$/i ] );

    Optional. As opposed to "banned" argument, the "root" argument allows
    access only to people whose usermasks match any of the regexen you
    specify in the arrayref the argument takes as a value. By default: it is
    not specified. Note: as opposed to "banned" specifying an empty arrayref
    to "root" argument will restrict access to everyone.

   trigger
        ->new( trigger => qr/^utf8?\s+(?=\S)/i );

    Optional. Takes a regex as an argument. Messages matching this regex
    will be considered as requests. See also addressed option below which is
    enabled by default. Note: the trigger will be removed from the message,
    therefore make sure your trigger doesn't match the actual data that
    needs to be processed. The possible argument to the plugin (from IRC
    that is, after stripping the trigger) can be a unicode character, or
    code base either in a form of "U+263a" (case insensitive) or 0x263a.
    Defaults to: "qr/^utf8?\s+(?=\S)/i"

   addressed
        ->new( addressed => 1 );

    Optional. Takes either true or false values. When set to a true value
    all the public messages must be *addressed to the bot*. In other words,
    if your bot's nickname is "Nick" and your trigger is "qr/^trig\s+/" you
    would make the request by saying "Nick, trig EXAMPLE". When addressed
    mode is turned on, the bot's nickname, including any whitespace and
    common punctuation character will be removed before matching the
    "trigger" (see above). When "addressed" argument it set to a false
    value, public messages will only have to match "trigger" regex in order
    to make a request. Note: this argument has no effect on "/notice" and
    "/msg" requests. Defaults to: 1

   listen_for_input
        ->new( listen_for_input => [ qw(public  notice  privmsg) ] );

    Optional. Takes an arrayref as a value which can contain any of the
    three elements, namely "public", "notice" and "privmsg" which indicate
    which kind of input plugin should respond to. When the arrayref contains
    "public" element, plugin will respond to requests sent from messages in
    public channels (see "addressed" argument above for specifics). When the
    arrayref contains "notice" element plugin will respond to requests sent
    to it via "/notice" messages. When the arrayref contains "privmsg"
    element, the plugin will respond to requests sent to it via "/msg"
    (private messages). You can specify any of these. In other words,
    setting "( listen_for_input =" [ qr(notice privmsg) ] )> will enable
    functionality only via "/notice" and "/msg" messages. Defaults to: "[
    qw(public notice privmsg) ]"

   eat
        ->new( eat => 0 );

    Optional. If set to a false value plugin will return a "PCI_EAT_NONE"
    after responding. If eat is set to a true value, plugin will return a
    "PCI_EAT_ALL" after responding. See POE::Component::IRC::Plugin
    documentation for more information if you are interested. Defaults to: 1

   debug
        ->new( debug => 1 );

    Optional. Takes either a true or false value. When "debug" argument is
    set to a true value some debugging information will be printed out. When
    "debug" argument is set to a false value no debug info will be printed.
    Defaults to: 0.

EMITED EVENTS
  response_event
        $VAR1 = {
            'who' => 'Zoffix!n=Zoffix@unaffiliated/zoffix',
            'what' => '☺',
            'type' => 'public',
            'channel' => '#zofbot',
            'message' => 'UnicodeBot, utf ☺',
            'result' => 'U+263A (0xe2 0x98 0xba): WHITE SMILING FACE [☺]',
        };

    The event handler set up to handle the event, name of which you've
    specified in the "response_event" argument to the constructor (it
    defaults to "irc_unicode_ucd") will recieve input every time request is
    completed. The input will come in $_[ARG0] in a form of a hashref. The
    keys/values of that hashref are as follows:

  who
        { 'who' => 'Zoffix!n=Zoffix@unaffiliated/zoffix' }

    The usermask of the person who made the request.

  what
        { 'what' => '☺' }

    The user's message after stripping the trigger.

  type
        { 'type' => 'public' }

    The type of the request. This will be either "public", "notice" or
    "privmsg"

  channel
        { 'channel' => '#zofbot' }

    The channel where the message came from (this will only make sense when
    the request came from a public channel as opposed to /notice or /msg)

  message
        { 'message' => 'UnicodeBot, utf ☺' }

    The full message that the user has sent.

  result
        { 'result' => 'U+263A (0xe2 0x98 0xba): WHITE SMILING FACE [☺]' }

    The result of the request.
